<h1>FLASH IMAGE ROTATOR 3.2 README</h1>
<p id="lead">The Flash Image Rotator enables you to show a couple of photos in sequence, with fluid transitions between them. It supports rotation of an RSS/XSPF playlist with JPG/GIF/PNG images, a wide range of flashvars (settings) for tweaking both behavior and appearance and an extensive, documented javascript/actionscript API.

<h2 id="installing">INSTALLING</h2>
<p>The example imagerotator.html works right out of the box. If you look at it's source code (in a text or HTML editor), you can see that the imagerotator is inserted in the page with a small javascript. This javascript use the external ufo.js script by <a href="http://www.bobbyvandersluis.com/ufo/">Bobby van der Sluis</a> in order to prevent the annoying "click here to activate" message. If you copy the imagerotator to your website, make sure you don't forget to copy the ufo.js file as well. The ufo.js is inserted in the HTML page right at the top:</p>
<pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="ufo.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>An insertion javascript allows you to set the location of the movie, it's width and height, the version and build of Flash that is needed (just leave this to 7 and 0) and the backgroundcolor of the movie. You can also send a list of so-called Flashvars to the script (for that see the next paragraph):</p>
<pre>&lt;p id="player1"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer"&gt;Get the Flash Player&lt;/a&gt; to see this player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  var FO = { movie:"imagerotator.swf",width:"600",height:"200",majorversion:"7",build:"0",bgcolor:"#000000",
             flashvars:"file=playlist.xml&amp;transition=bgfade" };
UFO.create(FO,"player1");
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>When the HTML page loads, the javascript replaces the part of your HTML with the "id" you provided in the javascript (in this case the paragraph with the id "player1"), and you have an image rotator running on your website.</p>
<p>If you cannot use javascript on your website (for example if you run the imagerotator on a profile site like MySpace), you can use an "embed" code instead of the javascript. Your imagerotator.swf will probably be on another server then. That is OK, but note that your playlist.xml should always reside on the same server than your SWF, or else the Flash security restrictions won't allow the imagerotator.swf to load it:</p>
<pre>&lt;embed src="http://www.myfileserver.com/folder/imagerotator.swf" width="300" height="200" bgcolor="#000000"
type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" 
flashvars="file=http://www.myfileserver.com/folder/playlist.xml" /&gt;</pre>


<h2 id="flashvars">FLASHVARS</h2>
<p>The flashvars are settings you can insert into your HTML code to control both behavior and appearance of the imagerotator. In the installation example above, you can see how to insert these flashvars: just insert them into the "flashvars" attribute of your embed code, and stack them with the "&amp;" symbol. Here is a list of all flashvars, their default values are bold:</p>
<table>
<tr id="thead"><td id="name">Name</td><td id="values">Values</td><td>Explanation</td></tr>
<tr><td>file</td><td>URL (<b>playlist.xml</b>)</td><td>The location of the playlist file to play. For more info about playlists, see below.</td></tr>
<tr class="tlight"><td>shuffle</td><td><b>true</b>,false</td><td>Normally the imagerotator will shuffle through the images. Set this to "false" if you want them to show in order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>backcolor</td><td>COLOR (<b>0xFFFFFF</b>)</td><td>Backgroundcolor of the imagerotator navigation. In the "extras" folder of this download there's a colorpicker script with which you pick a right hexadecimal color.</td></tr>
<tr class="tlight"><td>frontcolor</td><td>COLOR (<b>0x000000</b>)</td><td>Texts / buttons color of the imagerotator. In the "extras" folder of this download there's a colorpicker script with which you pick a right hexadecimal color.</td></tr>
<tr><td>lightcolor</td><td>COLOR (<b>0x000000</b>)</td><td>Rollover/ active color of the imagerotator navigation items. In the "extras" folder of this download there's a colorpicker script with which you can pick a hexadecimal color.</td></tr>
<tr class="tlight"><td>linkfromdisplay</td><td><b>true</b>,false</td><td>If you set this to false, your imagerotator will not jump to the image's link on click, but rotate to the next image.</td></tr>
<tr class="tlight"><td>linktarget</td><td>FRAME (<b>_SELF</b>)</td><td>This is the target frame in which the links pages will show up. Set it to "_blank" to open them in a new window.</td></tr>
<tr><td>showicons</td><td>true, <b>false</b></td><td>If set to true, the play and activity (for loading) icons in the display will show.</td></tr>
<tr class="tlight"><td>overstretch</td><td><b>true</b>,false,fit,none</td><td>This flashvars controls the stretching of images. The value "fit" will scale them disproportionally to exactly fit the display, "true" will scale proportionally to fill the display, "false" will scale proportionally to fit the display and "none" won't scale  the images at all.</td></tr>
<tr class="tlight"><td>rotatetime</td><td>NUMBER (<b>10</b>)</td><td>Number of seconds an image should be displayed before rotating to the next.</td></tr>
<tr><td>shownavigation</td><td>true,<b>false</b></td><td>Set this to true to show the navigation bar.</td></tr>
<tr class="tlight"><td>transition</td><td><b>fade</b>,bgfade, circles, blocks, fluids, lines, random</td><td>This flashvar sets the type of transition to use. The "random" transition will randomly pick one of the other transitions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>callback</td><td>URL (<b>undefined</b>)</td><td>You can set the location of a server-side script here to track callback statistics. The imagerotator will send the url, title and id of any song that is either started or completed by the user. A small example of a statistics script can be found in the "extras" folder of this download.</td></tr>
<tr class="tlight"><td>enablejs</td><td>true, <b>false</b></td><td>Set this to "true" to enable javascript interaction. An example of how to control the rotator with javascript can be found <a href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/embed/javascript.html">here at my website</a>. The example uses the mediaplayer, but all controls are similar to the ones for the image rotator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>width</td><td>NUMBER</td><td>Force the width of your movie if you have a messed-up display in IE. Normally, just setting the width in your HTML will be sufficient.</td></tr>
<tr class="tlight"><td>height</td><td>NUMBER</td><td>Force the height of your movie if you have a messed-up display in IE. Normally, just setting the height in your HTML will be sufficient.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Note that you can urlencode your flashvars in order to prevent the use of the ? = &amp; symbols. The urlencoded values for these symbols are: <i>?</i> &rarr; <i>%3F</i>,  <i>=</i> &rarr; <i>%3D</i>, <i>&amp;</i> &rarr; <i>%26</i>. So if your "file" flashvar has the value of getimages.php?id=23421, you can set it like this: getimages.php%3Fid%3D23421.</p>


<h2 id="playlists">PLAYLISTS</h2>
<p>The imagerotator supports two commonly used playlist formats to ensure maximum compatibility: <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss">RSS</a> (much-used for Podcasts - and Flickr Feeds) and <a href="http://www.xspf.org">XSPF</a> (much used for CC playlists). The example playlist.xml of this download is in XSPF format. Here is a list of all flashvars and their corresponding XSPF/RSS tags that are supported by the imagerotator. Their names should be self-explanatory:</p>
<table>
<tr id="thead"><td>Flashvar</td><td>XSPF Tag</td><td>RSS Tag</td></tr>
<tr><td>file</td><td>location</td><td>enclosure or media:content</td></tr>
<tr class="tlight"><td>title</td><td>title</td><td>title</td></tr>
<tr><td>link</td><td>info</td><td>link</td></tr>
<tr class="tlight"><td>id</td><td>identifier</td><td>guid</td></tr>
</table>
<p>I'd like to point out two common pitfalls users encounter when using playlists. First, a playlist should always reside on the same server as the SWF file, due to security restrictions of the Flash Player (there is a small workaround, the "external_feed.php" in the "extras" folder of this download). Second, always try to use full URL's (including the http:// part) when referring to files, links or images in your playlists. It will save you a lot of troubles with unresponsive imagerotators or "file not found" errors!</p>
<p>I've included some additional playlist-related files in the "extras" folder of this download. First, the "force_download.php" script will enable you to force a download of your image instead of opening them in your browser or any other program. If you copy this script to your website and fill out the "link" tags of your playlist like this: "force_download.php?file=path_to_my_file.jpg", a click on the image in the rotator will result in a download of the file.</p>
<p>Second, the "extras" folder contains a PHP example of how to create a playlist on-the-fly, either by pulling data off a database or scanning a certain directory for mediafiles. In both cases you can feed the php file to the imagerotator with the "file" flashvar.</p>


<h2 id="history">HISTORY</h2>
<ol>
<li>3.2: Various bugfixes. Added "targetlink" and "showicons" Flashvars. Added play/pause/duration support for SWF files. Added "fit" and "none" parameter to "overstretch" flashvar. Enabled "loadFile()" function for actionscript/javascript. [<a  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/upload/flash_image_rotator.zip">download</a>]</li>
<li>3.1: Some bugfixes. Bottom images are hidden in between transitions. </li>
<li>3.0: Complete rewrite of the image rotator. Added RSS/XSPF support, title display, a new transition and lots of flashvars.</li>
<li>2.1: Latest version called the JPG Rotator. Includes config and file settings in a single XML file and simple navigation buttons. [<a href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/upload/flash_jpg_rotator_21.zip">download</a>]</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="support">SUPPORT</h2>
<p>This player will run quite OK inside the Flash Player 7. However, the following features are not supported: display of GIF/PNG images, smoothing of scaled images and javascript control.</p>
<p>I receive a lot of requests for creating customized versions of my players. In most cases however, a clever setting of the flashvars already fulfilled the requests, so please make sure you check the list of flashvars first! Additionally, I do not design or program any particular (paid-for) customizations (I just don't have time for it), but interesting features will be plugged into the next update of the players. I created a <a href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?forum=Third_Party">Third Party</a> forum category on my website to bring together site owners and freelance developers.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with actionscripting yourself, you should find that changing or adding to the players is quite simple. To get started, I've provided <a href="../source/doc/index.html">a clear documentation</a> of the code, including a <a href="../source/doc/Schematic_Overview.html">schematic overview</a> of the players.</p>
<p>For tips, tricks, additional info and bug reports, you can always have a look at my forum's <a href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?forum=Flash_JPG_Rotator">Flash Image Rotator threads</a>.</p>
